JSON Schema's for OCPI

Each OCPI module has its own representation in a JSON Schema file.
For now, we've have oly created a schema-file for mod_locations. You are invited to help create schema's for the other modules.

You are free to use these schema's in your project.
Please feel free to contribute to this project through pull-requests or by opening tickets / issues.
